Password Keeper by Alex Andreev (Dandi91@github.com)

About:
  Password Keeper is a cross-platform application capable of secure storing
  your passwords and related information (ex. login, email, etc.).
  I have plans for adding synchronization functions using a server application
  under Linux platforms. It will include updating passwords through a server
  and a web interface in case you don't have an access to a client in certain
  places (public machines or smartphones, for example).
  There also might be an Android application in the far future.

Security:
  AES256-CTR is used for local stored data. For a secure internet transactions
  I plan to use RSA for handshaking/verifications and AES256-CTR for content
  exchange.

Libraries:
  GUI is built using wxWidgets (wxwidgets.org). Used version: 3.0.2
  Cryptography is provided by crypto++ (cryptopp.com). Used version: 5.6.2

Building/Compilation:
  Under Windows, a binary can be compiled using Code::Blocks IDE and GCC 
  (project included). You should set up correct paths and specifications for
  your wxWidgets and crypto++ libraries in order to compile Password Keeper.
  In the future there will be a makefile for different toolchains.

  Under Linux, you can compile a binary using GNUmakefile and GCC toolchain
  (Code::Blocks project for Linux systems is also provided). Available options
  for the makefile are BUILD=debug\release and STATIC=yes\no. Of course, you
  have to have compiled and installed wxWidgets and crypto++ libraries with 
  correct versions on your machine. In the future I will rework the makefile
  for different toolchains as well.

Version history:
  v0.1 alpha
    The first release of a basic stable version without network synchronization.
    Minor bugs included.
