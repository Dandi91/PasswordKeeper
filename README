Password Keeper by Alex Andreev (Dandi91@github.com)

About:
  Password Keeper is a cross-platform application capable of secure storing
  your passwords and related information (ex. login, email, etc.).
  I have plans for adding synchronization functions using a server application
  under Linux platforms. It will include updating passwords through a server
  and a web interface in case you don't have an access to a client in certain
  places (public machines or smartphones, for example).
  There also might be an Android application in the far future.

Security:
  AES256-CTR is used for local stored data. For secure internet transactions
  I plan to use RSA for handshaking/verifications and AES256-CTR for content
  exchange.

Libraries:
  GUI is built using wxWidgets (wxwidgets.org). Used version: 3.0.2
  Cryptography is provided by crypto++ (cryptopp.com). Used version: 5.6.2

Building/Compilation:
  Windows
    GCC (MinGW)
      All you need is to say 'mingw32-make -f makefile.gcc'
      Options (can be changed directly in the makefile or provided through
      command line):
        BUILD=debug/release (default - release)
        UNICODE=yes/no (default - yes)
        WX - you have to specify the path to your installation of wxWidgets
          It should be a directory that contains 'include' and 'lib' subdirs.
        CRYPTOPP - you have to specify the path to your crypto++ library.

    Under Windows, a binary can be also compiled using Code::Blocks IDE
    (project included). You should set up correct paths and specifications for
    your wxWidgets and crypto++ libraries in order to compile the binary.

  Linux
    GCC
      A makefile provided.
      Options:
        BUILD=debug/release (default - release)
        STATIC=yes/no (default - no)
      Of course, you have to have compiled and installed wxWidgets and crypto++
      libraries with correct versions on your machine.

    Under Linux, you can compile a binary using Code::Blocks project for Linux
    systems, which is also provided.

Version history:
  v0.1 alpha
    The first release of a basic stable version without network synchronization.
    Minor bugs included.
